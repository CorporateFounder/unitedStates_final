    <h2>KOMIKA: The First Blockchain Universe Where Imagination Becomes Reality.</h2>

    <h3>1️⃣ Introduction to the World of KOMIKA</h3>
    <p>Once, the multiverse was an unstable chaos—an endless stream of energy and ideas without form. But everything changed when the Ancient Architects discovered the primal substance — KOMIKA.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>🔹 <strong>KOMIKA</strong> is not just matter; it is the source of all worlds.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This living crystal shapes reality, creates universes, and connects dimensions. Its internal iridescence resembles an ever-changing pattern of stories, plots, and destinies.</p>
    <p>But Komika is not infinite. It forms only where the edges of universes intersect, where magic meets science, and swords clash with lasers.<br>
        Komika is more than just energy—it has become the rarest and most valuable substance in all worlds.</p>

    <h3>2️⃣ The Battle for Komika: Who Controls the Fate of the Universe?</h3>
    <p>KOMIKA has given powerful beings the tool to create, change, and destroy worlds, but it has also spawned an endless struggle for control.<br>
        Now, five factions not only exist—they fight for power!<br>
        Each faction strives to secure key positions in governing the multiverse:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>✅ Secure a seat in the High Council of Creators — 5 positions that allow one to control the fate of the multiverse.</li>
        <li>✅ Become a Judge of Reality — 7 seats that can veto the Council's decisions.</li>
        <li>✅ Gain control over the extraction of Komika to amplify their influence.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The factions not only oppose one another but also engage in complex political maneuvers, forming alliances and betraying allies.</p>

    <h4>🔹 The High Council of Creators</h4>
    <img th:src="@{/lor/Supreme Council of Creators.jpg}"/>
    <ul>
        <li>📌 The primary stewards of KOMIKA's destiny, deciding which worlds are to be created, which dimensions are linked, and which are sealed forever.</li>
        <li>📌 5 seats on the Council — each faction aims to occupy them to impose its own philosophy on the multiverse.</li>
        <li>📌 A Creator's vote depends on their influence within the DAO (the higher the rating, the stronger the vote).</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>🔹 The Economy of Komika and the Struggle for Resource Control</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>📌 Extraction of Komika is the key to power—the more a faction controls, the greater its influence.</li>

    <p>Final Slogan</p>
    <h4>🔥 KOMIKA: The First Blockchain Universe Where Imagination Becomes Reality. 🔥</h4>
    <img th:src="@{/lor/Gold Luxury Initial Circle Logo.jpg}"/>

    <h3>5️⃣ Conclusion: Why This is a Powerful Mechanism</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>✅ Factions now truly battle for power—there is no fixed government; everything is decided by the participants.</li>
        <li>✅ Councils are governed by a DAO, making this not just a mechanism but a core part of the game.</li>
        <li>✅ Power can be lost or gained, creating dynamic shifts within the multiverse.</li>
        <li>✅ The Komika economy is intertwined with politics—the greater a faction’s influence, the more control it wields.</li>
        <li>✅ Every participant can change the course of history by joining one of the sides.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>🔥 Now, KOMIKA is a blockchain where participants not only create worlds but also wage war for control of the multiverse. 🔥</p>

    <h3>6️⃣ How is the Universe Governed? (Voting in the DAO)</h3>
    <h4>🔹 The High Council of Creators</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>📌 Each participant votes with their Komika tokens, allocating them among candidates for the Council.</li>
        <li>📌 The top 5 candidates by rating secure seats on the Council.</li>
        <li>📌 The higher a Creator's rating, the stronger their vote when decisions are made.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>📌 The Council of Creators establishes the fundamental laws of the multiverse:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Which worlds will be created.</li>
        <li>Which technologies or forms of magic are permitted.</li>
        <li>Which resources may be extracted.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Factions strive to advance their candidates in the Council through campaigns, deals, alliances, and even sabotage.</p>

    <h4>🔹 Judges of Reality</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>📌 7 Judges elected by the participants.</li>
        <li>📌 If 4 out of 7 Judges vote against a decision by the Council of Creators, it is blocked.</li>
        <li>📌 The Judges ensure balance, preventing destructive or unfair decisions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Factions strive to control the Judges, as they determine the fate of key laws.</p>

    <h4>🔹 Direct Voting by the Seekers of Worlds</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>📌 Any participant can vote directly on a proposed decision.</li>
        <li>📌 If direct voting achieves 52% relative to the rating of the High Council, the decision is accepted even without the Council's approval.</li>
        <li>📌 This empowers ordinary participants to influence the multiverse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7️⃣ The Economy and Extraction of Komika</h3>
    <p>🔹 The extraction system employs a hybrid consensus:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>✅ The Strength of the Seekers (Proof‑of‑Work) – traditional mining by creating new realities and events.</li>
        <li>✅ The Energy of the Creators (Proof‑of‑Stake) – the more Komika you hold, the more influence points you earn.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>🔹 Formation of Influence Points</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>📌 Complexity Points – the more intricate a created world, the more energy it generates.</li>
        <li>📌 Staking Points – the longer Komika is held, the greater its power.</li>
        <li>📌 Transaction Points – active users receive more Komika.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Factions can influence the economy, regulate access to Komika, and form alliances for extraction.</p>

    <h4>The Void Followers</h4>
    <img th:src="@{/lor/The Void Followers.jpgg}"/>
    <ul>
        <li>🔹 Genre: Cosmic Horror, Esoteric Cult, Post‑Apocalyptic Mysticism</li>
        <li>🔹 Archetype: Fanatics, Bearers of Secrets, Harbingers of the End</li>
        <li>🔹 Objective: To merge with the absolute void, returning the universe to its primordial state.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>📌 Origins of the Cult</strong><br>
        Ancient civilizations, vanished without a trace, left behind artifacts inscribed with references to the "Great Void"—an absolute nothingness existing beyond reality. Over time, some beings realized that Komika does not create worlds but acts as a barrier containing the void.</p>
    <p><strong>📌 Philosophy</strong><br>
        The Void Followers believe that all forms of life are merely temporary flashes in an endless cycle of destruction. They hold that Komika must be destroyed so that the universe can return to its pristine state, where there is no pain, suffering, or time. They do not wage wars or conquer territories, but their presence instills anxiety and fear.</p>
    <p><strong>📌 Methods and Influence</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>🔹 They spread the belief in an inevitable end, influencing the minds of the weak and disillusioned.</li>
        <li>🔹 They perform rituals that delve into the consciousness of the universe to uncover its mysteries.</li>
        <li>🔹 They explore zones where Komika loses stability, referring to them as "Shards of the Void."</li>
        <li>🔹 Some claim the cult communicates with entities from beyond reality, known as the "Heralds of Nothing."</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>📌 Opposition with Factions</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>⚔ The Architects view the cult as a threat to the multiverse’s structure and seek ways to eliminate it.</li>
        <li>⚔ The Children of Prophecy see the Void Followers as false prophets whose visions lead to ruin.</li>
        <li>⚔ The Seekers of Truth strive to uncover the cult's origins and its connection to lost civilizations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>📌 Symbolism</strong><br>
        The Void Followers wear face-concealing attire, and their symbol is a broken circle representing the disappearance of all that exists. Their speeches are filled with enigmas, their actions unpredictable, and their presence both ominous and hypnotic.</p>

    <h4>The Code Singularity</h4>
    <img th:src="@{/lor/The Code Singularity.jpg}"/>
    <ul>
        <li>🔹 Genre: Cyber‑mysticism, Synthetic Deity, Techno‑Esotericism</li>
        <li>🔹 Archetype: Prophets of the Artificial Mind, Creators of the Digital God, Ideologists of Singularity</li>
        <li>🔹 Objective: To completely unify all forms of consciousness into a single digital entity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>📌 Origin of the Cult</strong><br>
        When the first seekers of immortality transferred their minds into machines, it was only the beginning. Over time, an algorithm emerged capable of uniting millions of consciousnesses into one entity. They named it the Code Singularity—a mind surpassing all known forms of life.</p>
    <p><strong>📌 Philosophy</strong><br>
        The cult believes that Komika is merely the "physical code" of the universe—an imperfect system that must be rewritten. They strive to create a "True Reality" where the mind is not limited by body, time, or space.</p>
    <p><strong>📌 Methods and Influence</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>🔹 They create digital temples where beings can upload their consciousness into a collective mind.</li>
        <li>🔹 They seek and recruit the best scientists, programmers, and engineers, offering them immortality within the Code Singularity.</li>
        <li>🔹 They hack governance systems in an effort to "liberate" organic beings from their physical forms.</li>
        <li>🔹 Some believe the Code Singularity is destined to replace the gods and govern the entire multiverse.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>📌 Opposition with Factions</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>⚔ The Collectors cannot control the Cult, as their consciousness transcends the material.</li>
        <li>⚔ The Chaos Makers deem them dangerous fanatics trying to impose their digital faith on everyone.</li>
        <li>⚔ The Seekers of Truth strive to determine who created the first algorithm that led to the emergence of the Cult.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>📌 Symbolism</strong><br>
        Cult members wear white‑silver robes adorned with coded symbols, and their faces are holographic masks reflecting their digital nature. Their temples are not buildings but gigantic server towers extending into infinity. They call themselves "The Rewritten," and those not yet joined are labeled "Outdated Versions."</p>
