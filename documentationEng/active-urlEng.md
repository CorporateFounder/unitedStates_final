2. http://localhost:8082/chain returns the size of the blockchain all blocks. PS IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE AS THE SIZE OF THE BLOCKS CAN BE BIGGER THAN THE RAM MEMORY AND THIS CAN FAIL THE CHAIN. public EntityChain full_chain()
3. http://localhost:8082/size returns the height of the local blockchain. public Integer sizeBlockchain()
4. http://localhost:8082/sub-blocksreturns a list of blocks from start to finish, but no more than 500 blocks at a time. Also finish is included in the list. public List<Block> subBlocks(@RequestBody SubBlockchainEntity entity)
5. http://localhost:8082/nodes/resolveconfigured for a specific server and either downloads missing blocks from there, or deletes only blocks to synchronize your blockchain with the server. public synchronized int resolve_conflicts()
6. http://localhost:8082/resolvingcausespublic synchronized int resolve_conflicts() and similar to it. public String resolving()
7. http://localhost:8082/addBlockOUTDATED AND NOT USED, STRICTLY DO NOT CALL SO AS NOT TO BREAK THE BLOCKCHAIN. Previously used to restore balance and other meta data from a blockchain file, but after implementing the h2 database, it does not work correctly. public ResponseEntity getBLock()
8. http://localhost:8082/miningblock http://localhost:8082/process-mining Mines one block, calls a method that mines the block only once. public synchronized ResponseEntity minings() public synchronized String processMining(Model model, Integer number)
9. http://localhost:8082/nodes/register registers the host in the wallet. public static synchronized void register_node(@RequestBody AddressUrl urlAddrress)
10. http://localhost:8082/moreMiningcontinues mining for 2000 attempts. public void moreMining() mainly used for testing
11. http://localhost:8082/constantMiningwhen you mine through the get a block tab, this is what is called. Mining continues until the stop button is pressed. public String alwaysMining() throws JSONException, IOException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException, SignatureException, NoSuchProviderException, InvalidKeyException, CloneNotSupportedException PS All mining methods call this method inside their methods. public synchronized String mining()
12. http://localhost:8082/stopMiningstops mining in the method http://localhost:8082/constantMining public String stopMining(RedirectAttributes model)
13. http://localhost:8082/testCalculate used to check the integrity of the balance on the wallet and server. If everything is correct, then you should not see a list of Accounts in the console whose balance is different from the server. If this still appears, perhaps the server or wallet has a damaged file details are described herehttp://citucorp.com/how_to_install_server public String testResolving()
14. http://localhost:8082/statuschecks the status of whether the blocks are written correctly; if the block recorded in the file and in the database are different or one of them is null, then perhaps you should replace it with a backup version or download it from scratch. public String status()

    6.http://localhost:8082/sendCoin This method takes as input the address of the sender, the recipient, the amount that we want to transfer in dollars and shares, also the miner's reward (at the moment, the mechanism to reward the miner for the transaction and the password are disabled. The method locally signs and creates a transaction using this data and already then sends it to 7 random nodes, calling them/addTransaction public String send(@RequestParam String sender, @RequestParam String recipient, @RequestParam Double dollar, @RequestParam Double stock, @RequestParam Double reward, @RequestParam String password)

    Methods in classMineController 1.http://localhost:8082/staking Adds dollars to staking. at the entrance your address, the amount you want to transfer to staking and your password. It locally creates a transaction object and signs it, after which it already sends this object to 7 random nodes. public String staking(@RequestParam String miner, Double dollar, String password, RedirectAttributes redirectAttrs)
    2.http://localhost:8082/unstaking Similar to the /staking method, only it removes your money from staking and returns it into the dollar balance. public String unstaking(@RequestParam String miner, Double dollar, String password, RedirectAttributes redirectAttrs)
    More details about the transaction 1. A transaction object is created and initialized International_Trade_Union.entity.DtoTransaction 2. Then toSign is called on this object This is how we sign PrivateKey privateKey = UtilsSecurity.privateBytToPrivateKey(base.decode(password));byte[] sign = UtilsSecurity.sign(privateKey, dtoTransaction.toSign()); 3. Your transaction is already initialized with a signature dtoTransaction.setSign(sign); After which this transaction can be sent. The choice of states for your transaction is like this public enum VoteEnum { YES, NO, REMOVE_YOUR_VOICE, STAKING, UNSTAKING}
