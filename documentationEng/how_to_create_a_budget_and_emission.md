# BUDGET AND EMISSION
## BUDGET
### HOW THE BUDGET IS REPLENISHED
The budget can be replenished in the same way as the regular budget.
1. You can mine coins on this account.
2. You can simply transfer to it
3. or through the issue, indicate this account as one of the recipients.

### HOW TO REMOVE MONEY FROM THE BUDGET.
1. To withdraw from the budget, you need to create a law with the name of the BUDGET package.
   Within a package, the list of laws within a package must be separated by a space.
   First comes the address, then the amount in digital dollars, and then in digital shares.
2. After you need to enter the tab ***budgets and issues for which you can vote now***
3. Take an address from there and give this address to other participants so that other participants can
   vote which is in the ***vote*** tab
4. Every 15 days, only one package of laws will be approved that received the most
   votes in the vote stock rating (at least 300,000 rating votes).
5. ***budgets and issues for which you can vote now*** only show packages of laws from
   the moment the laws were created did not take more than 15 days.
6. All approved budgets are displayed on the tab ***all adopted budgets and issues***

But the amount should not exceed the amount that is in the budget.

# HOW TO MAKE AN EMISSION
The issue is similar to the budget, instead of BUDGET you need the package name EMISSION.
Also, the issue should not be higher than 25,000 per package. Once every 15, you are allowed to spend up to 25,000 digital dollars.
Thus, it is not possible to create shares only digital dollars.
The balance of the issue is reset every 15th day, so there is no need to transfer to it.
