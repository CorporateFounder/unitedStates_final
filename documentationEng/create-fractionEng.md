# Create a faction
## How factions are created
Fractions are created similarly to other positions such as the Board of Directors.
You need to enter the ***apply for a position*** tab, select
from the FRACTION drop-down list. Give a reward of 5 coins to the miner and
so that the sender's address and the first line of the law match.
Factions are always led by leaders, so you always vote for the leader and
there can always be several ideologically identical factions that lead
different leaders. You must think of the faction chamber as a leader chamber.

## What is the difference between the factions then.
The difference between the factions lies in the voting system, namely when it casts its vote,
a member of the Board of Directors or a member of the Board of Shareholders, then one account equals one vote.
At the same time, the faction's vote is equal to the share of votes it received.
To do this, the votes of all 100 factions are summed up, and each then the share of each faction is determined.
Example: if your faction received 23% of the share, then the vote will be equal to 23%.
