If your version is lower than the global one, be sure to download the new version,
otherwise you will not be able to mine coins. Versions must match

A unique project has been made, with unique features that can prevent such crises as stagflation and a deflationary spiral.
This coin is based on economic schools and takes into account macroeconomics. Based on the theories of Monetarism by Milton Friedman,
Silvio Gesell free money, Austrian School of Economics and Elements of the labor theory of value.


## Preamble
Hi all.
Before downloading, I would like you to read the text below.
My cryptocurrency was inspired by the US Constitution and the parliamentary system of government.
My system implements a system that allows all participants to create laws and approve laws through democratic procedures.
Imagine a world where residents of the USA, Mexico, Canada or other regions elect their representatives and approve laws,
and also through direct democracy, but I need you to participate, I am a developer and can modify
code so that the legal system becomes better. We will all be like the founding fathers of digital democracy.

What are its advantages.
1. There are 576 blocks in a day, for each block it is given if the block index is even (difficulty * 30) coins, if not even
   (difficulty * 30) + 1 coin. where difficulty is equal to the number of zeros in the hash.
2. Two unique digital dollar and digital stock coins.
3. There is no halving; instead, the limitation occurs by burning coins from all accounts in the amount
   0.2% every six months for digital dollars and 0.4% for digital stocks.
4. A unique electoral system inspired by the principles of libertarianism, the English and New Zealand parliaments and
   US Constitution.
5. It has a unique mining system built on the basis of SHA-256 (A valid block must have the number
   zeros in the hash string equal to the amount of complexity and the number of zeros in the hash bits must be 2).

6. Difficulty adapts every 288 blocks.
7. An election system that allows you to elect your representatives to different branches of government and directly vote for them.
8. A unique system of government consisting of elements of the English parliament and a charter inspired by the constitution
   USA and libertarian principles, including NAP.
9. The ability to mine blocks directly on a local server, which automatically connects to the global server, which only stores,
   updates and returns the current blockchain.
10. All settings are made taking into account knowledge in the field of Macroeconomics and such schools as Milton Friedman’s Monetarism were taken into account,
    Austrian School of Economics (Mises, Hayek), Silvio Gesel - money with demurrage and other books.
11. The algorithm is designed in such a way that over time the economy will grow more steadily and have a more stable rate,
    which will prevent future crises such as Deflationary Spiral and Stagflation, and allow for the optimal development of all humanity.
    the total number of coins never exceeds 10 billion dollars and 5 billion shares unless the difficulty is higher than 10.
12. Ultimately this system will be able to function as a Confederation or Federation for humanity
    and eliminate problems such as financial crises (Deflationary Spiral, Stagflation, Galloping Inflation, etc.)
    Pandemics, Space Threats, Environmental problems and will reduce the occurrence of military conflicts.


## Mission.
Using a new economic model that is resistant to deflationary and inflationary crises,
unite humanity into a single democratic trading network. Our digital democracy is resilient to stuffing
and parliament represents all sections of society. First of all, we are creating a democratic platform,
where the views of all participants must be heard. The goal is to unite people of different views, different religions,
regions and social groups to solve social and economic problems, as well as reduce conflicts between
countries and the economic growth of mankind.
