and you will find out why you need this cryptocurrency and what problem it solves.
In the world there are a huge number of financial instruments and views that there is money.
There are national money, gold and cryptocurrencies.
Initially, bitcoin was created due to the fact that national money is subject to high inflation.
and most often inflation is due precisely to political causes, and fractional reserve banking.
With national currencies there is a problem of strong inflation and most often in the modern world,
it is inflation that occurs in countries with a national currency, a complete depreciation of the currency is also possible,
as it was with the Soviet ruble. You do not want to accumulate savings all your life and find out in your old age,
that your money has depreciated, or worse, ceased to exist.
Gold, although not subject to inflation, has its drawbacks, and the main one is that you cannot protect them.
An example of the United States, when they began to take gold from people. And this happened not in totalitarian countries, but in one
from democratic countries.
Here is an excerpt from Wikipedia "According to the decree, all physical and
legal entities (including foreign citizens and companies that have stored gold in the United States),
with rare exceptions, were required before May 1, 1933 to exchange gold for paper money at a price of $20.66.
For a troy ounce at any bank in the United States that at that time had the right to accept gold.
Also, any contracts and securities denominated in gold were declared illegal, payments on them were ordered to be made
paper money in accordance with the specified exchange rate."
By the way, the great and indestructible dollar also turned out to be already in question of its existence.
The rise in US public debt is evidence of this.
And the problem is not even that a default may occur, since the United States can always raise the bar for public debt,
but that the country imports much more than it exports, which leads to an increase in the money supply.
Since the country's revenues are already being spent mainly on debt servicing.
Fractional reserve banking also contributes to this destruction of the dollar.
The fact is that with fractional reserve banking, the same dollar is given on credit several times,
more than there is real cash in the economy to pay off all the loans of money, in the economy
there is no such money and the state is forced to create new money.
Since the money supply grows closer to exponential, and the growth of the real economy is linear, this in turn creates
inflation and you lose your savings.
At the moment, I have deliberately not covered all the problems of macroeconomic crises, including the deflationary spiral and stagflation,
as it would take several dozen pages.
You might think, but there are bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, why not buy them.
Why won't these cryptocurrencies save your savings?
All cryptocurrencies are now divided into several subcategories.
1. Those that work on POW and POS, but we will not consider POS in this case, since it is more similar to fraud,
   since any participant can create several dozen branches without spending any resources from the real world.
2. There are limited edition coins, such as Bitcoin, which can only be created with twenty-one million coins.
3. There are coins with an unlimited number of issues, such as Dogecoin, which issues about five billion a year.

How is it that we consider only POW as the only reliable mechanism that has proven its performance over time,
we will use the example of only two cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin to discuss all similar currencies.
The problem with bitcoin and all currencies of this type is that bitcoin and similar coins reduce
your prey. For example, bitcoin halves its production every four years, but if miners mine
half as much, so that they remain profitable, the value of the coin must double, after each
abbreviations. Let me give you an example: In 2020, bitcoin was mined for 6 coins and the maximum value reached
twenty thousand, then at the time of writing this text, namely on May 25, 2023, the cost is 26222 dollars,
while mining is already only 3 coins per block. Now let's imagine that you are a miner and in order to save
your profitability, you must either increase the production of coins, and this is also limited to 144 blocks per day or
sell for more. Since you are not able to influence the market rate, you will be forced to increase the cost of payment for
transaction, since there are only 500 thousand transactions in a day, the cost of transactions will double so that you stay
cost-effective, but it will also encourage participants to spend less of their coins in the short term.
If you lose both sources of income, namely the reduction in production and the reduction in the number of transactions
tion, this
leads to bankruptcy.
As mining is declining, this should lead to more bankruptcies and monopolization of the coin.
and drop in hash rate because most miners will not be able to meet fixed costs such as hardware and
electricity while reducing income.
And in the end, in the near future it will lead to complete bankruptcy or a decrease in the value of the bitcoin coin,
the price of which will be much lower than twenty thousand.
And the assumption that when many people switch to bitcoin, and this will stabilize the rate is false!!
For example, bitcoin has about 80 million people, this is comparable to Germany, just
bitcoin is recognized as the national currency of El Salvador, but this did not stabilize the exchange rate and
this is no exception, it is a feature of all coins built similarly to bitcoin.
Then you might be wondering, but are there other coins like Dogecoin that don't limit their supply?
Yes, there are such people and they have their own problems, and one of the main problems is that production is constant and not limited in any way,
such coins are subject to inflation and are no better than national currencies, one might say they are even worse, since behind national
currencies, at least there is the economy of these countries. There are also currencies such as USDT that provide their stability.
other coins, but they suffer from the same problems as Dogecoin and others like them.
Can you think what to do? The dollar may collapse due to a series of crises, gold can be easily taken away,
bitcoin may cease to exist in the next twenty years and Dogecoin will always be subject to
large fluctuations in price, and is subject to high inflation, and it is worth purchasing these coins at your own peril and risk,
creating a portfolio of different currencies, BUT there is an alternative!!!
Up to this point, I myself was an ardent fan of bitcoin, but realizing that bitcoin will die and everyone like it
coins will also die. I started looking for a solution, and by studying many books on macroeconomics and researching
different strange, I designed my own coin.
My coin is also limited by the number of coins, BUT unlike bitcoin, there is no reduction in production in my coin.
How did I achieve this? Looking at countries such as Switzerland and Japan, I noticed that they apply a negative rate.
This has become an innovative idea in the field of cryptocurrencies, I realized if we withdraw the same percentage from all accounts
money and create the same amount of money as rewards, then no increase in the money supply will occur.
There are two coins in my currency, these are digital dollars and digital shares, if you withdraw 0.1% every six months
for digital dollars and 0.2% for digital shares, this allows miners to mine 200 coins of each type and with
In this case, the total amount of money will not increase, which also does not require a doubling of the value of the coins, since the coins
always mined in the same amount. Imagine it - as if you jointly rented a cell or several cells in a bank,
and each of you would store your gold there, but you would pay for storage depending on the amount of gold that each of you stores.
