## Mission.
Using a new economic model that is resistant to deflationary and inflationary crises,
unite humanity into a single democratic trading network. Our digital democracy is resilient to stuffing
and parliament represents all sections of society. First of all, we are creating a democratic platform,
where the views of all participants must be heard. The goal is to unite people of different views, different religions,
regions and social groups to solve social and economic problems, as well as reduce conflicts between
countries and the economic growth of mankind.

## Preamble
Hi all.
Before downloading, I would like you to read the text below.
My cryptocurrency was inspired by the US Constitution and the parliamentary system of government.
My system has implemented a system that allows all participants to create laws and approve laws through democratic procedures.
Imagine a world where a resident of the United States, Mexico, Canada or other regions will elect their representatives and approve laws,
and also using direct democracy, but I need you to participate, I am a developer and can modify
code to make the legislative system better. Together we will be like the founding fathers of digital democracy.

How is the law going now.
There are three groups of people who are elected and vote differently.
1. Independent members, each time you mine a block you are given 400 digital dollars and 400 digital shares.
   Every time you vote for a law, the law gets as many votes as you have shares, but with some nuances.
   Imagine you voted YES for 2 laws and NO for 4 laws and you have 100 shares. Then the laws you voted YES
   will receive 50 votes, for NO 25 votes (details are described in VOTE_STOCK). But it doesn't end there.
   Next, we summarize the votes of all participants cast for a particular law.
   We separately sum YES and separately NO and subtract from YES - NO and the result should be greater than 1.
   This is the rating of the law, and if the rating is positive, and if factions also approved it, then the law
   will act

2. Board of Shareholders. The Board of Shareholders consists of 1500 members with the largest number of shares.
   But only those accounts that were active during the year are taken into account.
   One score equals one vote. We also summarize for each law separately
   all YES and all NO and also subtract from YES - NO (participates only in the approval of amendments.)
   The Board of Shareholders may participate in the voting of laws, but then their votes will be counted as
   Independent members (details are described in ONE_VOTE).

3. And the last group is the leader factions, the leader factions consist of 200 accounts and are elected in the same way as the Board of Directors, but their
   votes are equal to shares. Example if the Leading Faction received 23% of the votes from 200 participants, then its vote is 23%.
   So, every time a faction votes for a law, we go through the same procedure as for the others. Namely, we summarize separately
   all YES and NO and subtract from YES - NO and the result should be more than 15%. Example one faction gave 23% FOR, and the other 13% against,
   thus the rating will be 10% < 15% which does not allow the adoption of the law.

For all participants, only votes from which no more than four years have passed are taken into account. Votes dynamically change with each block
taking into account how many shares are held by independent participants or retains or officials of their positions. A law is valid if it
more than 1 vote from Independents and 15% from factions.

There is no halving (reduction in production) in this system, but the total number of coins does not increase, since every six months from all accounts
0.1% of digital dollars and 0.2% of digital shares are burned.
