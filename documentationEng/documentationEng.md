# Important
If your version is lower than the global one, be sure to download the new version,
otherwise you will not be able to mine coins. Versions must match

A unique project has been made, with unique features that can prevent such crises as stagflation and a deflationary spiral.
This coin is based on economic schools and takes into account macroeconomics. Based on the theories of Monetarism by Milton Friedman,
Silvio Gesell free money, Austrian School of Economics and Elements of the labor theory of value.


Preamble
Hi all.
Before downloading, I would like to read the text below.
My meeting was inspired by the US Constitution and the leadership of the parliamentary system.
My system implements a system that allows all creators to create and approve laws through democratic procedures.
Imagine a world where the people of the United States, Mexico, Canada or other regions elect their representatives and recommend laws.
and also through the principle of democracy, but I need your participation, I am a developer and can change
code to make the legal system better. We will all be like the founding fathers of digital democracy.
What are its advantages?
1. There are 576 blocks per day, for each block you get (5+coefficient) * multiplier. Where the initial multiplier is 29, but decreases by one every year, but cannot be lower than one. The coefficient can be zero or 3. If you block this data above, select the unique sender in the previous block:
   sender's target transaction amount in the previous block: , the name of the number of unique senders, not including the base address, greater than the previous block, and subsequent all transactions greater than the previous block, not including the founder and miner reward.
2. Two unique digital dollars and digital cryptocurrency coins.
3. A unique electoral system inspired by the principles of libertarianism, the parliaments of England and New Zealand and the US Constitution.
4. Has a mining development system built on SHA-256, the block is valid if the conditions are effectively applied.
   public static String CalcultTarget(long complexity) {
   // Maximum target value (all f)

// String maxTarget = CalculationMaxTarget(difficulty);
Line maxTarget =Setting.MAX_TARGET;

      // Target calculation: maxTarget / difficulty
      BigInteger maxTargetValue = new BigInteger(maxTarget, 16);
      BigInteger targetValue = maxTargetValue.divide(BigInteger.valueOf(difficulty));

      // Convert target values in text to hexadecimal
      String target = targetValue.toString(16);

      // Zero padding up to 64 characters
      while (target.length() < 64) {
        target = "0" + target;
      }

      return target;
    }
    public static boolean isValidHash(String hash, String target) {
      boolean result = hash.compareTo(target) <= 0;
      return result;
    }

6. Difficulty changes in 288 blocks.
7. An electoral system that allows you to separate your representatives from different branches of government and directly vote for them.
8. A unique system of government consisting of elements of parliament and the statutes of parliament based on the constitution.
   USA and libertarian principles, including NAP.
9. The ability to mine blocks directly on a local server, which automatically connects to a global server that only hosts storage,
   updates and restores the current balance.
10. All settings are made taking into account knowledge in the field of macroeconomics and were taken into account in such schools as Milton Friedman's monetarism,
    Austrian School of Economics (Mises, Hayek), Silvio Gesel - idle money and other books.
11. The algorithm is designed in such a way that over time the economy will grow more steadily and at a more stable pace,
    which prevent future crises such as deflationary spiral and stagflation, and best ensure the development of all humanity, the total number of coins in 29 years will reach a maximum of less than a billion (844635200.000000.00000000) with the fundamental fact that participants will always receive an additional
    for coefficient (3). The minimum amount for 29 years, if the coefficient is not obtained, will be about half a billion (570272000.000000.00000000)
    with this increase in the total mass annually in 29 years there will be a minimum of min 1051200.000000.00000000 one million per year and a maximum of 1681920.000000.00000000




12. Ultimately this system will be able to function as a Confederation or Federation of Humanity.
    and solve problems such as financial crises (deflationary spiral, stagflation, runaway inflation, etc.)
    Pandemics, space threats, environmental issues and international mitigation.

## Mission.
use an economic model that is resistant to new deflationary and inflationary crises,
this means in a single democratic trading network. Our digital democracy is resistant to stuffing
Parliament represents all sectors of society. First of all, we are creating a democratic platform,
where there should be unique opinions of all participants. The goal is to know people of different views, different religions,
regional and social groups to solve social and economic problems, as well as take into account the differences between
countries and the economic growth of humanity..
