A unique project has been made, with unique features that can prevent such crises as stagflation and a deflationary spiral.
This coin is based on economic schools and takes into account macroeconomics. Based on the theories of Monetarism by Milton Friedman,
Silvio Gesell free money, Austrian School of Economics and Elements of the labor theory of value.


## Preamble
Hi all.
Before downloading, I would like you to read the text below.
My cryptocurrency was inspired by the US Constitution and the parliamentary system of government.
My system has implemented a system that allows all participants to create laws and approve laws through democratic procedures.
Imagine a world where a resident of the United States, Mexico, Canada or other regions will elect their representatives and approve laws,
and also using direct democracy, but I need you to participate, I am a developer and can modify
code to make the legislative system better. Together we will be like the founding fathers of digital democracy.

What are its benefits.
1. There are 576 blocks per day, for each block is given if the block index is even (difficulty * 30) of coins, if not even
   (difficulty * 30) + 1 coins. where difficulty is equal to the number of zeros in the hash.
2. Two unique digital dollar coins and digital shares.
3. No halving, instead, the restriction occurs by burning coins from all accounts in the amount
   0.2% semi-annually for digital dollars and 0.4% for digital stocks.
4. Unique electoral system inspired by the principles of Libertarianism, the English Parliament and
   the US constitution.
5. It has a unique mining system based on SHA-256.
6. Unique anti-centralization system. Such rules
   how the same address cannot mine a block twice in a row, and
   rule, if the index is even, only those whose balance of shares is even and not zero can mine,
   and if the index is not even, then that's it.
   Makes this system decentralized.
6. Difficulty adapts every 288 blocks.
7. An election system that allows you to create your own faction and directly vote according to the rules of the network.
8. Budgetary system, the state budget, which can be spent with the help of shareholders' votes.
9. Unique system of government, consisting of elements of the English parliament and a charter inspired by the constitution
   US and libertarian principles, including the NAP.
10. The ability to mine blocks directly on the local server, which automatically connects to the global server, which only stores,
    updates and returns the current blockchain.
11. All settings are made taking into account knowledge in the field of Macroeconomics and took into account such schools as Milton Friedman's Monetarism,
    Austrian School of Economics (Mises, Hayek), Silvio Gezel - money with demurrage and other books.
12. The algorithm is designed in such a way that over time the economy will grow more steadily and have a more stable exchange rate,
    which will prevent future crises such as the Deflationary Spiral and Stagflation, as well as allow for the optimal development of all of humanity.
    the total number of coins never exceeds 10 billion dollars and 5 billion shares if the difficulty is not higher than 10.
13. Ultimately, this system will be able to function as a Confederation or Federation for humanity
    and eliminate such problems as financial crises (Deflationary Spiral, Stagflation, Galloping inflation, etc.)
    Pandemics, Space Threats, Environmental Issues and will reduce the occurrence of military conflicts.

## Mission.
Using a new economic model that is resistant to deflationary and inflationary crises,
unite humanity into a single democratic trading network. Our digital democracy is resilient to stuffing
and parliament represents all sections of society. First of all, we are creating a democratic platform,
where the views of all participants must be heard. The goal is to unite people of different views, different religions,
regions and social groups to solve social and economic problems, as well as reduce conflicts between
countries and the economic growth of mankind.
