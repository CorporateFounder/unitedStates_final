## Mission.
Using a new economic model that is resistant to deflationary and inflationary crises,
unite humanity into a single democratic trading network. Our digital democracy is resilient to stuffing
and parliament represents all sections of society. First of all, we are creating a democratic platform,
where the views of all participants must be heard. The goal is to unite people of different views, different religions,
regions and social groups to solve social and economic problems, as well as reduce conflicts between
countries and the economic growth of mankind.

## Preamble
Hi all.
Before downloading, I would like you to read the text below.
My cryptocurrency was inspired by the US Constitution and the parliamentary system of government.
My system has implemented a system that allows all participants to create laws and approve laws through democratic procedures.
Imagine a world where a resident of the United States, Mexico, Canada or other regions will elect their representatives and approve laws,
and also using direct democracy, but I need you to participate, I am a developer and can modify
code to make the legislative system better. Together we will be like the founding fathers of digital democracy.

What are its benefits.
1. He has a unique mining system built on the basis of SHA - 256.
2. Difficulty adapts every 12 hours.
3. Two types of coins are mined at the same time, DIGITAL DOLLARS and DIGITAL SHARES.
4. A unique system that allows you to mine each block for 400 DIGITAL DOLLARS and 400 DIGITAL SHARES, while the total money supply does not constantly grow, since 0.2% of digital dollars and 0.4% of digital shares are burned from each account every six months.
5. An election system that allows you to create your own faction and vote on the rules of the network directly.
6. Budget system, a public budget that can be spent with the help of shareholder votes.
7. A unique system of government that is built with elements of the English Parliament and a charter that was inspired by the US constitution and Libertarian principles including the NAP.
8. The ability to mine blocks directly on the local server, which automatically connects to the global server that only stores, updates and gives the current blockchain.
9. There are 576 blocks per day.
10. All settings are made taking into account knowledge in the field of Macroeconomics and took into account such schools as Milton Friedman's Monetarism, the Austrian School of Economics (Mises, Hayek), Silvio Gezel - money with demurrage and other books.
11. The algorithm is designed in such a way that over time the economy will grow more steadily and will have a more stable course, which will prevent future crises such as the Deflationary Spiral and Stagflation, and also allow for the optimal development of all of humanity.
12. the total number of coins never exceeds 10 billion dollars and will reach this value in about 100 years.

Ultimately, this system will be able to function as a Confederation or Federation for humanity.
and eliminate such problems as financial crises (Deflationary Spiral, Stagflation, Galloping inflation, etc.)
Pandemics, Space Threats, Environmental Issues and will reduce the occurrence of military conflicts.
