Required if you have google translate installed, prohibit translating from English into Russian,
as everything is already written in Russian. But google translate starts translating the text, distorting the text from Russian into Russian.

How is the law going now.
There are four groups of people who are elected and vote differently.
1. Independent members, each time you mine a block you are given 400 digital dollars and 400 digital shares.
   Every time you vote for a law, the law gets as many votes as you have shares, but with some nuances.
   Imagine you voted YES for 2 laws and NO for 4 laws and you have 100 shares. Then the laws you voted YES
   will receive 50 votes according to the formula (YES/2), the same for NO/4=25. But it doesn't end there.
   Next, we summarize the votes of all participants cast for a particular law.
   Separately sum YES and separately NO and subtract from YES - NO and the result should be greater than 1.

2. Board of Shareholders. The Board of Shareholders consists of 1500 members with the largest number of shares.
   But only those accounts that were active during the year are taken into account.
   One score equals one vote. We also summarize for each law separately
   all YES and all NO and also subtract from YES - NO and the result must be 10 or more.

3. The Board of Directors is an analogue of the House of Representatives.
   Consists of 301 elected members. Members are elected by independent members and the 301 accounts that received
   the largest number of votes become members of the board of directors. One account is equal to one vote and how with the Board of Shareholders we are for each law
   sum separately YES and NO and subtract from YES - NO (participates only in making amendments)

4. And the last fourth group, these are fractions, fractions consist of 100 accounts and are elected similarly to the Board of Directors, but their
   votes are equal to shares. For example, if a Faction received 23% of the votes from 100 participants, then its vote is 23%.
   So, every time a faction votes for a law, we go through the same procedure as for the others. Namely, we summarize separately
   all YES and NO and subtract from YES - NO and the result should be more than 10%.

For all participants, only votes from which no more than four years have passed are taken into account. Votes dynamically change with each block
taking into account how many shares are held by independent participants or retains or officials of their positions. A law is valid if it
more than 1 vote from Independent Participants.
10 or more votes from the Board of Directors
and 10% or more from fractions. But the law must be approved by all 3 groups.
