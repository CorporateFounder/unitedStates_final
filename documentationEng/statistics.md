## 2.PERIOD (period)
1. There are 576 blocks per day. you can select DAY, WEEK, MONTH and YEAR.
2. WEEK = 576 * 7
3. MONTH = 576 * 30
4. YEAR = 576 * 360
   if you have chosen one of the overshoots, then you can see the division into these periods.

## 5, 7. velocity of money dollar end velocity of money stock
Displays the speed of circulation of money. The higher the speed, the higher the demand for this

P = median amount which is determined from all transactions for a given period, per
a given coin (dollar or shares).
T = Number of transactions in a given period
M = the total mass of dollars or shares for a given period.
(P*T)/M

## 6, 8. velocity of money dollar model 2 end velocity of money stock model 2
Similar to 5, 7, but as
M = Balance of all poisoners for the given period.
(P*T)/M
This indicator also says the larger it is, the higher the turnover rate,
the higher the demand for it.

## 9. count transactions
It takes into account all transactions for a given period, regardless of whether it is a dollar or shares.
The number of all transactions including dollars and stocks
they can match because in one transaction it can include both dollars,

The sum of all transactions for a given promotion period.

## 14. median transactions dollars
Median dollar transactions

## 15. median transactions stock
Median share transactions

## 16. count unique miner in days
All addresses that have mined a block at least once in a given period,
but only addresses are taken into account if they differ from each other,
Example: you have mined two blocks, another participant has mined one block,
but you used one address, so the number will be 2.

## 17. all account balance upper zero
