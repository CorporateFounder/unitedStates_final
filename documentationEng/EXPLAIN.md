# Why the cost of coins will rise.
There are many theories in the world and two of them are considered the most popular.
1. Austrian School of Economics - Marginal utility
2. Labor theory of value - Karl Marx made the completed form, although
   before him, this theory was developed by many other economists. Including
   Adam Smith, David Ricardo and many others.

Below I will give a very simplified explanation.
The first theory states that the cost of a product depends on supply and demand and
This is the basis of the Bitcoin principle, in other words, if demand exceeds supply
the cost increases, but the more you have of a given product, the less valuable it is.
A glass of water in the desert may cost more than gold, but a hundred thousandth glass can already
it costs nothing at all.

The second theory states that the value of a good depends on the costs of that good,
and the more expensive the costs, the higher the price.

In fact, both theories are completely complementary to each other, there are no goods on the market,
whose cost will be lower than its value and at the same time this product has been on the market for a long time.
Only large players, such as corporations and the state, can afford such pleasure.
who sell at a loss, and then the cost of this product is superimposed on other goods.
But the upper limit is already determined by the Austrian school.

The value of this coin is growing, since mining these coins requires spending your time.
equipment and the lower limit of cost will be determined by the amount of all costs
that you produced, by the number of coins that you mined.
But the upper cost will be determined by the saturation of the market with this coin.
Because of this, when we burn coins every six months, the price will be adjusted
and determine its real value.
This model creates an ascending price corridor, where small fluctuations within this corridor do not
bring down its value.

## Brief summary.
The value of this coin will grow more steadily and smoothly.
Your savings are more likely to be saved than any
other national currencies and cryptocurrencies.
Your mining will become full-fledged and more stable, since you no longer need to
you will have to worry about a decrease in production (halving).
Users are confident that mining will never stop, which means
their transactions are safe and so are their accounts.
The total number of coins will not increase, which means there will be no depreciation
and inflation. There is no high volatility, which means you will not have
such problems as in Bitcoin, when you bought at a price of 60 thousand, and it
in two days it dropped to 20 thousand. Your coins retain their value
in relation to goods or even increase it in five years, for those
With the same coins you will buy as many goods or more.
