# Explanation of everything that happens here.
## Why is there no halving here.
Most of the coins that have broken away from bitcoin are halving.
This measure was created to limit the number of coins, and thus
create an artificial scarcity of coins. Which in turn should increase
coin value.
But halving has several problems.
Let's imagine: you are a miner and bought equipment for 140 thousand dollars
and in order to stay in profit, it is enough for you to find one block per month,
bitcoin, which at the moment costs 30 thousand dollars, and 6 coins are given per block.
Which is equal to 180 thousand dollars. Now imagine that there was a halving,
and the number of mined coins was reduced to three, which is equal to 90 thousand dollars.
If the value of the coins is not doubled, then this miner will incur losses.
And then, in order to remain profitable, the miner must
1. mine twice as many blocks.
2. increase the cost of the transaction.


It is not always possible to increase production twice.
Since the number of blocks per day is strictly limited to 144 blocks.
At the same time, if the cost of the transaction also grows, the owners
bitcoin, it will be more profitable to spend less. As a result, halving in the end
eventually collapse in any case, as no product on the market can
double its value permanently.
From this event, you can realize that all coins built on halving,
are in the long run a pyramid and only those who have mined in
beginning and was able to sell first.

## How we solve this problem in this coin.
We get such a task that production should not be reduced,
so that the miners remain in profit, but the money supply should not grow.
What the solution to this problem looks like, we burn 0.2% from all accounts
digital dollars every six months, and 0.4% of digital shares every six months.
What does it give. In a day you can find about 576 blocks (the difficulty adapts every 288 blocks, by one unit), and for each block
give 400 digital dollars and shares. For a year in this system, we take 360 days.
Thus 400 * 576 * 360 = 82944000. This means when the amount of digital dollars
will reach and will be a little more than 20,000,000,000 and the amount of digital shares will reach
and will be a little more up to 10,000,000,000, monetary
mass stop growing. Because the number of created will be equal to the number
destroyed coins. How is it that 0.4% of digital dollars are destroyed per year and
0.8% digital shares. 10,000,000,000 * 0.8 / 100 = 80,000,000.
Imagine that you were renting a storage cell with your friends,
and each of you pays the same amount, depending on the amount borrowed
them as a percentage.

## What benefits does this give us for network members.
1. First, mining, to become a full-fledged business, because
   now the miners know that their income will not decrease.
2. For miners to remain profitable, the value of the coin is not necessarily
   should increase enough to keep the value at about the same level.
3. How is the total mass growing, linearly, and money is burned in percentage
   variant, the increase in the money supply will resemble an S-shape.
4. Since all participants know the date of burning coins from their accounts,
   then as the date approaches, large holders will sell their coins,
   which will lead to price correction and the rate will become stable.
5. Instead of the price growing in bitcoin for a long time,
   without a correction, and when this happens, the value drops a lot and
   causes panic, but in this system corrections are created artificially
   and often that does not give high volatility.
6. The above advantages give a stable price, and this
   contributes to the preservation of your savings, not only in the short term
   perspective, but also in the long term.
7. Since the value of the coin is stable, it is beneficial for participants to become
   it is more profitable to invest this money and run a reliable business with this money.

## What does this mean for the whole society.
This coin stimulates investments by burning coins, which
in turn reduces unemployment, as well as poverty, as well
exchange rate becomes resistant to fluctuations. Also the index
jinnies will give a more equitable distribution of income, and
contribute to reducing the stratification of society.

## Why is there a budget in this system.
Imagine a situation where you want to buy a product,
but you do not know the quality of this product and whether this
the seller is honest. You need a regulatory body that
would be an intermediary and check the quality of the goods, but this work
costs money and each of you does not want to pay separately for
this service, but everyone needs such a public good.
Then each of you can jointly spend money on the budget
and jointly decide what public goods you want to receive.

## Who decides how to spend the budget
All participants who have shares can take
decisions on how to spend the budget.
Detailed here
[BUDGET AND EMISSION](../documentationEng/how_to_create_a_budget_and_emission.md)
Brief explanation:
1. Participants create a law, where the package name is BUDGET
2. There is a list inside the law and each line looks like tak:
   Account_address 50(amount indicated in dollars) 20(amount indicated in shares.).
   Each line is separated by a space, the first is the address, followed by the dollar amount separated by a space, and
   shares that we want to transfer to this address.
3. This package is only valid for 15 days.
4. There can be many such packages
5. Next, the participants vote for the address of the package, which always starts with LIBER.
6. Only the package that received the most votes is approved and money from the balance
   budget are transferred to the accounts described in this package, if the amount does not exceed the budget balance.
7. All your shares are equal to your votes, then when you vote for one of the budgets,
   For each budget, all votes cast as YES are summed and all votes are summed separately
   given as no, then we subtract the amount YES - NO and
8. The result must be higher than 300000, after which all packets are sorted in descending order, where at the top
9. The package that received the most votes. And that is what is being affirmed.

## Why the value of coins will rise.
There are many theories in the world and two of the most popular are two of them.
1. Austrian School of Economics - Marginal Utility
2. Labor theory of value - Karl Marx made the completed form, although
   before him, this theory was developed by many other economists. Including
   Adam Smith, David Ricardo and many others.

I'll give a very simplified explanation below.
The first theory states that the value of a commodity depends on supply and demand and
the principle of bitcoin is based on this, in other words, if demand exceeds supply
the cost increases, but the more you have of this product, the less valuable it is.
A glass of water in the desert may cost more than gold, but a hundred thousandth glass can already
worth nothing at all.

The second theory says that the value of a good depends on the cost of that good,
And the more expensive the costs, the higher the price.

In fact, both theories are complete and complement each other, there are no goods on the market,
whose value will be lower than its own value and at the same time this product has been on the market for a long time.
Only large players, such as corporations and the state, can afford such pleasure.
who sell themselves at a loss, and the value of this commodity is superimposed on other commodities.
But the Austrian school already defines the upper limit.

The value of this coin is growing, as the extraction of these coins requires the expenditure of your time.
equipment and the lower limit of the cost will be determined by the amount of all costs
that you have produced, by the number of coins that you have mined.
But the upper cost will be determined by the saturation of the market with this coin.
Because of this, when we burn coins every six months, the price will be adjusted.
and determine its real value.
This model creates an upward price corridor, where small fluctuations within this corridor do not
crush its value.

## Summary.
The value of this coin will grow more steadily and smoothly.
Your savings are more likely to be kept than any
other national currencies and cryptocurrencies.
Your mining will become complete and more stable, as you no longer
will have to worry about a decrease in production (halving).
Users are sure that mining will never stop, which means
their transactions are safe, as are their accounts.
The total number of coins will not grow, which means there will be no depreciation
and inflation. No high volatility, which means you won't have
such problems as in bitcoin, when you bought at a price of 60 thousand, and he
in two days it fell to 20,000. Your coins keep their value
in relation to commodities or even increase it in five years, for those
the same coins you buy as many goods or more.
