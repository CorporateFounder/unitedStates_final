   from highest to lowest, after that the 301 accounts that have the most votes (VOTE_STOCK) are selected.
2. Council of Chief Justices (CORPORATE_COUNCIL_OF_REFEREES) Elected in the same way, but 55 accounts are selected (VOTE_STOCK).

### Option 1
If more than 100,000 votes (residue) were voted by the number of shares,
Then the law is valid

### Option 2
If the law received 100 votes of the Board of Shareholders (the remainder of the votes) and
15 votes of the Board of Directors (remainder of votes) and the vote of the Chief Justice,
Law approved

### Option 3
If the law received 200 votes of the Board of Shareholders (balance of votes)
and 30 votes of the Board of Directors (balance of votes)
The law has been approved.

All three methods are legitimate.
