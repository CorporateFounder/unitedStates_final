# Brief description of the cryptocurrency

This cryptocurrency is a whole eco-system that allows not only to exchange
monetary units, but also in this system an electoral system is implemented,
allowing you to elect your representatives who will promote your interests in this network.
It also allows you to create rules (laws) for which your representatives will vote, and all
network members will instantly be able to see what decisions have been made.

The system also implements direct democracy, which allows you to directly vote for the rules of the network (laws).


Also, this coin implements the Demurrage mechanism, 0.1% every six months, a digital dollar and
0.2% for a digital share.
Demurrage is a service fee, this mechanism is used in many countries,
and it's called a negative rate, but the most direct application was
The first practical application of Gesell's views was an experiment in 1932 in the Austrian town of WÃ¶rgl with a population of 3,000 people.

This measure provides frequent course corrections, which allows this System to be as
crisis-resistant and do not depreciate quickly.

There are two types of currencies in the system - digital dollars and digital stocks,
576 blocks can be mined per day, each block gives 200 coins
each type.
In this package they are
***src/main/java/International_Trade_Union/utils/UtilsBlock.java***

Difficulty is determined by the formula and is corrected every half a day.
