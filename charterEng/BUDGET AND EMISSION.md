# BUDGET AND EMISSION.

## BUDGET
The company's budget is the BUDGET address. You can both send money and withdraw money to this address.
How to withdraw money from this account.
1. First, a Law (Document) is created with the name budget and in this package,
   in the form of lists, addresses should be written and, separated by a space, the amount of the digital dollar and digital shares.
2. Next, the participants vote for one of these packages using the VOTE_STOCK method.
3. Packages are taken into account, from which the time of creation of these laws has not gone more than 15 days.
4. The one package that receives the most votes becomes valid, and
   amounts are withdrawn from it (only those packages in which at least 300,000 votes are taken into account).
5. You can spend from the budget balance once every 15 days. A digital year is 360 days, and there are 576 blocks in one day.


## ISSUE
The issue allows you to create up to 25 thousand digital dollars every fifteen days.
An issue is created in the same way as a budget, with the only difference that the name of the package must
be EMISSION.

The budget and Emission are primarily intended for spending public goods and developing the system.
This includes judges and other employees.
Also, you cannot spend more than the amount from the budget than it is, and you cannot spend
more than 25 thousand digital dollars for issue in one document.
Every 15 days for the issue of no more than one hundred thousand digital dollars.
