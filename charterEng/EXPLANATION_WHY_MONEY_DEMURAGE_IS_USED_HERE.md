# EXPLANATION WHY MONEY DEMURAGE IS USED HERE
The negative rate is now applied in many countries, this measure stimulates money holders when the price is excessively high,
saturate the market with money.
The amount of money mined for each block is 400 digital dollars and 400 digital shares,
also 2% of each mining reward to the founder, which is 4 digital dollars and 4 digital Shares for each block mining.
Here it is used as the Theories of Silvio Gesell, as well as the school of monetarism in a modified form.

With Silvio Gezel, the negative rate was 1% per month, which would just kill the economy,
under monetarism, the growth of the money supply had to be proportional to the growth of GDP, but since in
this system fails to calculate the real GDP growth, I set a fixed growth, also if the monetary growth
will equal GDP, there is a high probability of Hyperinflation, since GDP does not always reflect real economic growth.
Money must be solid so that a business can predict its long-term investments and from monetarism, only the part that
the money supply should grow linearly, but in general there is a mix of different economic schools, including the Austrian School of Economics.

With a negative rate of 0.1% every six months for digital dollars and 0.2% for digital stocks, we avoid the consequences of a severe economic crisis for this currency.

Such a mechanism creates a price corridor where the lower limit of the value of these digital currencies is the total number of issued digital currencies.
dollars and digital stocks, and the upper limit is the real value. Since as soon as the value becomes higher than the real value,
it becomes more profitable for holders to sell digital dollars and digital shares at inflated prices, thereby saturating the market with money
and creating a correction in the market.

The main source of monetary crises is rapid changes in commodity prices and slow changes in wages.
Example: Imagine that the value of the currency has risen sharply by 30%, it becomes more profitable for holders not to invest money, since
income from holding currency, higher than now pay more expensive employees, because of the fact that the money stops
invest. People do not receive wages, which leads to the fact that a huge number of goods are not sold,
and this leads to the fact that some manufacturers go bankrupt and lay off many workers, which further reduces wages.
wages from the rest, as the labor market becomes surplus.

Which, in turn, causes even more fear among money holders to invest, and this process continues until the moment when
until the value of money starts to decline due to the fact that the total number of production chains has decreased and goods have also decreased.
"
Example: Let's imagine that we had inflation and the value of money fell by 40% within a month, the cost of goods increases sharply,
but wages have not risen, so a lot of goods will not be bought, which leads to the closure of production chains,
which, in turn, due to an excess of workers in the labor market, reduces wages, which also further reduces
the number of goods sold.
The first case A deflationary spiral occurs due to a sharp reduction in money in the market, the second
stagflation occurs more often when a sharply excess amount of money enters the market.
And these two phenomena are two sides of the same coin, in one case we get a deflationary spiral in the other
stagflation.

To avoid such crises, in this cryptocurrency, money grows in the same predictable amount.
408 (8 - founder's reward, 400 - earner's reward)
digital dollars and shares per block, about 576 blocks per day. A negative rate adjusts the value of coins every six months.
It is also forbidden to use fractional reserve banking for these coins, as their number grows linearly, and
will not be able to cover the debts incurred due to fractional reserve banking, due to lack of
cash, since with fractional reserve banking, the increase in debt will be much higher than this protocol will create money.

Also, if you increase the money supply by changing the settings, and making the money supply increase much higher, it can cause hyperinflation or
even galloping inflation. If it is necessary to increase the growth of the money supply, this should only happen through amendments,
keeping the founder's remuneration percentage at two percent. And mining per block should not increase more than 5% for
ten years, each subsequent increase that may be made must pass at least ten years through amendments,
and no more than 5% per block from the reward of the last block. (Example: if we change
through the amendments, then the extraction should not be higher than 420 coins, but each following will be no more than five percent of the last.
Thus, the next increase introduced by without amendment will be 440.10 coins. But this amendment will be introduced only in ten
years after the first production adjustment)

With a lack of money supply, if the number of mined coins has not been changed through an amendment, you can add a few
additional zeros after the decimal point, so it will simply increase the value of the coins, without increasing the total money supply.

Negative rates should not be higher than 0.5% per annum and lower than 0.2% per annum. Negative rates can only be changed through amendments.
