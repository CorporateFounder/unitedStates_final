# EXPLANATION WHY MONEY DEMURAGE IS USED HERE
Imagine that you are a miner in one of two cryptocurrencies.
One of them halves the income of the cryptocurrency every four years per block.
Similar to bitcoin.
The second has a fixed income per block, which does not change like dogecoin.
If you are a cryptocurrency miner like Bitcoin, your costs are fixed.
You buy a farm, but there is a big problem if the income is halved,
then you must sell coins at twice the price to remain profitable.
Since if every four years production will be reduced, then in order for this
the system remains viable, the cost must double.
How do you not affect the market, you will be forced to reduce the size of the farm in order to
remain profitable, but this will also lead to a decrease in cost.
The number of blocks in bitcoin is limited to 144 blocks, which in any case will not allow
increase profitability and income from transactions cannot double every 4 years, how so
at what point will it become unprofitable to pay for small purchases at an inflated price, which
will reduce turnover.
In other words, for such a system to remain profitable, it is necessary that the cost
doubled every four years.

If you are a miner of dogecoin, or similar coins, then you have another problem.
Such coins have the main problem of high inflation. Let's imagine such a situation,
a crisis arose and the cost of all coins fell a little, then mine with old equipment
became unprofitable. Then the miners reduce the equipment, but this reduces security,
which in turn reduces the value, but the coin continues to be issued in the same quantity.
Instead of reducing production, it continues to grow, which creates
even more problems.

How my coin solves these problems.
1. Every six months, 0.2% of digital dollars and 0.4% of digital dollars are destroyed from all accounts.
   digital shares, which does not allow the money supply to grow and it should not be 10 billion
   dollars and 5 billion shares with a difficulty of 10.
2. Unique mining system, if the index is even then the income is equal to difficulty * 30,
3. If the index is not even, then (difficulty * 30) + 1.
4. if the index is even, then only those addresses whose share balance is even can be added to the blockchain.
5. if the index is not even, then everything.
6. difficulty is equal to the number of zeros in the block hash.
7. Two times the same address cannot add a block.

Now, given all of the above parameters, we can conclude.
A negative rate stimulates the sale of coins, which creates a rate correction every
half a year and does not allow big falls. It also stimulates turnover and limits
mining of coins. How so the number of coins created and destroyed will be equal.
And the dynamic loot change system increases the loot when the difficulty
increases, which allows to meet demand and reduce production when demand falls.
This measure makes the coin rate more resistant to fluctuations.


With Silvio Gezel, the negative rate was 1% per month, which would just kill the economy,
under monetarism, the growth of the money supply had to be proportional to the growth of GDP, but since in
this system fails to calculate the real GDP growth, I set a fixed growth, also if the monetary growth
will equal GDP, there is a high probability of Hyperinflation, since GDP does not always reflect real economic growth.
Money must be hard so that a business can predict its long-term investments and from monetarism, only the part that
the money supply should grow linearly, but in general there is a mix of different economic schools, including the Austrian School of Economics.

With a negative rate of 0.2% every six months for digital dollars and 0.4% for digital stocks, we avoid the consequences of a severe
economic crisis for this currency.

Such a mechanism creates a price corridor where the lower limit of the value of these digital currencies is the total number of issued digital currencies.
dollars and digital stocks, and the upper limit is the real value. Since as soon as the value becomes higher than the real value,
it becomes more profitable for holders to sell digital dollars and digital shares at inflated prices, thereby saturating the market with money
and creating a correction in the market.

The main source of monetary crises is rapid changes in commodity prices and slow changes in wages.
Example: Imagine that the value of the currency has risen sharply by 30%, it becomes more profitable for holders not to invest money, since
income from holding currency, higher than now pay more expensive employees, because of the fact that the money stops
invest. People do not receive wages, which leads to the fact that a huge number of goods are not sold,
and this leads to the fact that some manufacturers go bankrupt and lay off many workers, which further reduces wages.
wages from the rest, as the labor market becomes surplus.

Which in turn causes even more fear among money holders to invest and this process continues until
"until the value of money starts to decline as the total number of production chains has shrunk and commodities have also shrunk.

Example: Let's imagine that we had inflation and the value of money fell by 40% within a month, the cost of goods increases sharply,
but wages have not risen, so a lot of goods will not be bought, which leads to the closure of production chains,
which, in turn, due to an excess of workers in the labor market, reduces wages, which also further reduces
the number of goods sold.
The first case A deflationary spiral occurs due to a sharp reduction in money in the market, the second
stagflation occurs more often when a sharply excess amount of money enters the market.
And these two phenomena are two sides of the same coin, in one case we get a deflationary spiral in the other
stagflation.

To avoid such crises, in this cryptocurrency, money grows in the same predictable amount.
If the market has grown, then the demand for money will increase, which will attract more miners to mine this coin, which in turn
will increase the complexity and thereby increase the number of coins, according to the formula described above, if, on the contrary, demand has fallen,
the difficulty will drop and the loot will decrease, which will make the course more predictable. There are 576 blocks per day.

A negative rate adjusts the value of coins every six months.
It is also forbidden to use fractional reserve banking for these coins, as their number grows in smaller numbers, and
will not be able to cover the debts incurred due to fractional reserve banking, due to lack of
cash, since with fractional reserve banking, the increase in debt will be much higher than this protocol will create money.

Also, if you increase the money supply by changing the settings, and making the money supply increase much higher, it can cause hyperinflation or
even galloping inflation.
