All members of the network must respect Natural Human Rights and not violate them.
The presumption of innocence must also be respected and each network participant must have the rights to fair, independent
trial.
Each participant has the right to a lawyer or to be his own lawyer.
In general, we also adhere to the same principles as stated in the US Bill of Rights.

The International Trade Union Corporation should not regulate the cost of goods and services of network participants that
sold through this platform.
Also, the Corporation should not ban certain brands on its site, but may
prohibit the sale of entire groups of goods that fall within the characteristics described by current laws, if
this prohibition does not violate Natural Human Rights. You can take as a source of rights
as a precedent Countries recognized as democratic countries.
